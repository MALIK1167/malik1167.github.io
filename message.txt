# **Hey Maha,**

So, funny story 💀💀. Valentine’s Day pulled up, and my bank account looked at me like, “Bro, we got nothing.” 💀 But don’t even worry, ‘cause I got something money can’t buy: **pure, top-tier, one-of-a-kind boyfriend effort.**

I've been working on this code for weeks now(yes, full geek mode), ‘cause you deserve something special, and right now, my only rich attribute is my love for you. 😌💕 Every letter here was typed with care, every line of code written with love, and if my laptop had emotions, it would be blushing.

I know I joke around a lot, but to be honest, you mean the world to me. You make my days better, my jokes funnier (debatable, I know), and my life feel like it’s running on the best algorithm ever. If love was a program, you’d be the only function I’d ever call.

So, happy Valentine’s Day, my love. No money, no problem—as long as I got you, I’m rich in the ways that count. ❤️

**With all the love (and zero dollars),**
MOHAMEEEEED
